        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I have found spiritual and physical healing through my passion for fitness. I believe practicing with your body through fitness helps to create harmony in our lives, setting footprints on the ground on our path to a fulfilling life.</p>
        <p>I had a dark past, one of which I could have easily stayed in the shadows. Instead of letting the past engulf me for the rest of my days, I found safety and strength through physical fitness.</p>
        <p>Through my journeys I discovered along the way that a positive light was always visible to me. In fact it had always been there, but it was shrouded until the point in my life I finally decided to pull back the curtains. I discovered an enriching spiritual life, great health and vibrant wellness.</p>
        <p>I understand that finding time, motivation, and commitment to oneself at the beginning of your practices can be very challenging. But that is why it's called "practice" and practicing takes patience with yourself. It will get much easier and I'd say keep with it, and be kind to yourself. You are worth the investment.</p>

        <p>2014 will be my 13th season as an age group triathlete. I have competed in many triathlon events, locally, nationally, and internationally. I have completed 6 full Ironman's, nearly 30 Half Ironmans, and many, many triathlons in other distances, and I have been extremely successful competitively. I have placed in many of these events. My long term goal is to qualify for the Kona Ironman before I am 80 years old. I have done many running races including road, trail, and mountain in a wide range of distances, many being marathons.</p>

Along with being a Race Director for the St. Katharine road race, and competing in my aR races, I work with the founder of aR, Chris Dunn, and to direct races as an Event Organizer, an endeavor which I want to passionately pursue.</p>
